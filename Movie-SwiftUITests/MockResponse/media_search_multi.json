This way of life influenced the anti-establishment style and attitude that defined a generation. The cultural phenomenon was best captured when Volcom released \"Alive We Ride\" in 1993: a film documenting the raw excitement and spontaneous creativity inherent to the lifestyle. Twenty-one years later, with the release of \"True To This\", Volcom again captures the energy and artistry of board-riding in its purest forms. Shot all around the world and showcasing iconic athletes, \"True To This\" is a tribute to the movement that inspired a generation and the people and places that embody that spirit today.",
